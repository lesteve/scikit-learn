=================================================
Pixel importances with a parallel forest of trees
=================================================

This example shows the use of a forest of trees to evaluate the impurity
based importance of the pixels in an image classification task on the faces
dataset. The hotter the pixel, the more important it is.

The code below also illustrates how the construction and the computation
of the predictions can be parallelized within multiple jobs.

Loading the data and model fitting
----------------------------------
First, we load the olivetti faces dataset and limit the dataset to contain
only the first five classes. Then we train a random forest on the dataset
and evaluate the impurity-based feature importance. One drawback of this
method is that it cannot be evaluated on a separate test set. For this
example, we are interested in representing the information learned from
the full dataset. Also, we'll set the number of cores to use for the tasks.

We select the number of cores to use to perform parallel fitting of
the forest model. `-1` means use all available cores.

Limit the dataset to 5 classes.

A random forest classifier will be fitted to compute the feature importances.

Feature importance based on mean decrease in impurity (MDI)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Feature importances are provided by the fitted attribute
`feature_importances_` and they are computed as the mean and standard
deviation of accumulation of the impurity decrease within each tree.

.. warning::
    Impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for **high
    cardinality** features (many unique values). See
    :ref:`permutation_importance` as an alternative.

Can you still recognize a face?

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 80-89

The limitations of MDI is not a problem for this dataset because:

 1. All features are (ordered) numeric and will thus not suffer the
    cardinality bias
 2. We are only interested to represent knowledge of the forest acquired
    on the training set.

If these two conditions are not met, it is recommended to instead use
the :func:`~sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance`.
